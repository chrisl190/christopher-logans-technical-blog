> I am currently a Mobile App Developer at BuffaloGrid

Recent work I've completed has inspired me to start posting technical articles on Medium.. They cover topics such as creating product flavours in an Android app, signing an Android app with an encrypted keystore and how to update Circle CI's configuration so that build artifacts are sent to Azure. All the articles are linked above.
